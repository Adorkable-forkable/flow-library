# Node-RED Library


This is the source of <http://flows.nodered.org>.

It provides a searchable index of user-contributed flows as well as node packages
published to npm.

The code is a bit of a mess as it has grown and been cobbled together. There is
a lot of tidying up to do.

It isn't really intended for reuse at the moment.
